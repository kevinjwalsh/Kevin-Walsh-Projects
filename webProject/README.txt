WELCOME TO OUR FINAL PROJECT

Before you do anything, you must first get your servers running. 
To do this you must install XAMPP and click "start" on the Apache and MySQL servers. 

You then must put this entire folder into a folder called "htdocs". This folder is located inside the XAMPP folder which was created after installing XAMPP. The full path should be "C:\xampp\htdocs". 

From there, you must create a new database on MySQL called "restaurant". 
To do this, you must go to your web broswer and type in "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php". From there you must click the "new" button on the top of the left dropdown menu. From there fill in the input field labeled "Database Name" with "restaurant".

You must then add the tables and initial data to the database.
To do this, you can use the attached file labeled "initialData.sql" and upload that to the database. To do this, you must go to your new database and click the "import" tab and hit the "choose file" button. From there you simply select the file and click go. 

From there you are ready to start up the website. 
while XAMPP is still running the Apache and MySQL servers, go to your browser once again and type in "http://localhost/web-programming-nerds-main/webProject/index.php". 

You should now be on the website! From here you can view the menu and contact page, create an account to log into, and make/ cancel reservations. Enjoy!
